    <h1>The Bachu 15 criteria</h1>
    <div class="mar">
      <p>
        An overall ranking score would take these and other criteria into
        account to arrive at a quantitative evaluation regarding a basin’s
        suitability for CO2 sequestration. The table presents a set of 15
        criteria for assessing and ranking sedimentary basins in terms of their
        suitability for CO2 sequestration or storage. The list can be expanded
        further if more criteria are developed. Three to five classes have been
        defined in each category listed from the least favourable to the most
        favourable for CO2 sequestration or storage (Bachu, 2003). However, if
        CO2 geological sequestration or storage are to be implemented on a large
        scale, then there is need for a systematic, quantitative analysis of
        sedimentary basins in terms of their suitability

      <p>
        For each criterion i (i=1,..15) in Table 1 for evaluating basin
        suitability, a monotonically increasing numerical function Fi is
        assigned, which can be continuous or discrete, to describe a value
        placed on the specific class j for that criterion. The smallest and most
        outstanding values of this function characterize the worst and best
        class in terms of suitability for that criterion, i.e., Fi,1= min (Fi)
        and Fi, n = max (Fi), n represents the number of classes in that
        criterion (n=3, 4, or 5). If the classes have relatively equal
        importance assigned to them, then a linear function is probably best for
        Fi. If an increasing value (or importance) is placed on increasingly
        favourable classes, geometric or exponential functions are probably
        better. Table 2 presents the numerical values assigned by Bachu (2003)
        here to the various classes for the criteria in Table 1. The weights
        (wi) can be changed or adapted to changing conditions and priorities,
        where wi are weighting that satisfies the condition, of the total weight
        is equal to one (1).

    <h1>The Modified 15 criteria from Bachu and Kaldi and Gibson-Poole</h1>
    <br />
    <div class="mar">
      <p>
        In 2008, the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies
        (CO2CRC) in Australia produced a report on methods for estimating CO2
        storage capacity and storage site selection and characterisation. Kaldi
        and Gibson-Poole(2008) created a new table adapted for the Bachu (2003);
        the adapted table indicates a significant difference between the
        criteria for basin-scale assessment in terms of suitability for CO2;
        some numerical values were modified, refined or added.
      </p>

      <p>
        As in Bachu (2003) table , each i evaluates the basin suitability. Each
        j position is for the smallest and most great values characterize the
        worst and best classes in terms of suitability for criterion

    <h1>The ranking</h1>
    <br />
    <div class="mar">
      <p>
        For any sedimentary basin k evaluated regarding its general suitability
        for CO2 sequestration or storage, the corresponding class j for each
        criterion is identified, resulting in a corresponding score F_(i,j).
        Because the function Fi has different ranges of values for each
        criterion, making comparisons and manipulations difficult, the
        individual scores F_(i,j) are normalized according to: (Bachu, 2003)
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51975792290_3476a2400b_b.jpg"
        width="200"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        As a result of this process, each sedimentary basin k being evaluated is
        characterized by 15 individual scores P_i^k, such that if Pi is closer
        to zero (Pi ≈ 0) is least favourable and if the Pi is closer to one (Pi
        ≈ 1) most favourable it is. The consequence of the parameterization and
        normalization is that it transforms various basin characteristics, which
        have differing meanings and importance, into dimensionless variables
        that vary between 0 and 1. These can subsequently be added to produce a
        general score Rk, used in basin ranking, which is calculated using:
        (Bachu, 2003)
      </p>
      <img

        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        Using this methodology, sedimentary basins, or parts thereof, within a
        geographic region can be assessed and ranked in terms of their
        suitability for the geological storage of CO2. (Bachu, 2003). When
        results of the ranking closer to one (Rk ≈1) are most favourable, and
        those closer to zero (Rk ≈0) are less favourable for CO2 storage.
        However, it is essential to note that the results of this ranking
        process are not absolute when making a final decision.
